      "content": "# Chore: Display 7 Days of the Week\n\n## Chore Description\nUpdate the client main page to display a weekly planner view showing 7 days of the week. Each day should display:\n- The day of the week name (Monday through Sunday)\n- The date for that day\n- A box/container where tasks for that day will be displayed\n\nThe title of the page should show the week number of the year (1-52). This creates the foundation for a weekly task planner interface where users can visualize and manage their tasks across the entire week.\n\n## Relevant Files\nUse these files to resolve the chore:\n\n- `app/client/src/app/app.component.ts` - Main component that will contain the weekly planner logic\n  - Add logic to calculate the current week number (1-52)\n  - Add logic to generate an array of 7 days starting from Monday of the current week\n  - Add logic to format dates and day names\n  - Add data structures to hold day information (day name, date, tasks)\n\n- `app/client/src/app/app.component.html` - Main component template that will display the weekly view\n  - Replace the placeholder Angular template with the weekly planner UI\n  - Display the week number as the title\n  - Use Angular's `@for` control flow to loop through the 7 days\n  - Display each day's name and date\n  - Create task containers for each day\n\n- `app/client/src/app/app.component.css` - Main component styles for the weekly planner\n  - Replace the placeholder styles with custom styles for the weekly planner\n  - Add layout styles for the week grid (7 columns for 7 days)\n  - Add card/box styles for each day container\n  - Add styles for the week number title\n  - Add responsive styles for mobile/tablet views\n  - Add task container placeholder styles\n\n- `app/client/src/app/app.config.ts` - Application configuration\n  - Add HttpClient provider to enable API communication (needed for future task loading)\n\n### New Files\n- `app/client/src/app/services/task.service.ts` - Service to manage task data and API communication\n  - Create an Angular service to handle API calls to the backend\n  - Add methods to fetch tasks from the API\n  - Add data models/interfaces for tasks\n  - This service will be used in future stories to load and manage tasks\n\n- `app/client/src/app/models/task.model.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for task data\n  - Define the Task interface matching the backend model\n  - Include properties: id, title, description, day_of_week, time_slot, completed, created_at, updated_at\n  - This ensures type safety across the application\n\n## Step by Step Tasks\nIMPORTANT: Execute every step in order, top to bottom.\n\n### 1. Create TypeScript Models\n- Create `app/client/src/app/models/task.model.ts` file\n- Define the `Task` interface with properties matching the backend API model:\n  - id: number\n  - title: string\n  - description: string | null\n  - day_of_week: 'Monday' | 'Tuesday' | 'Wednesday' | 'Thursday' | 'Friday' | 'Saturday' | 'Sunday'\n  - time_slot: string\n  - completed: boolean\n  - created_at: string\n  - updated_at: string\n- Define a `DayInfo` interface to represent each day in the week view:\n  - dayName: string (e.g., \"Monday\")\n  - date: Date\n  - dateString: string (formatted date like \"Jan 20\")\n  - tasks: Task[] (array of tasks for that day, initially empty)\n\n### 2. Create Task Service\n- Create `app/client/src/app/services/task.service.ts` file\n- Implement an Angular service with `@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })`\n- Inject HttpClient for API communication\n- Define the API base URL (http://localhost:5173/api)\n- Create a `getTasks()` method that returns an Observable<Task[]>\n- Add proper error handling for API calls\n- This service provides a foundation for future task management features\n\n### 3. Update App Configuration\n- Update `app/client/src/app/app.config.ts`\n- Import `provideHttpClient` from '@angular/common/http'\n- Add `provideHttpClient()` to the providers array\n- This enables HTTP communication for the task service\n\n### 4. Update App Component TypeScript\n- Update `app/client/src/app/app.component.ts`\n- Import necessary Angular modules (CommonModule for date formatting)\n- Import the Task and DayInfo models\n- Add a property `weekNumber: number` to store the current week number (1-52)\n- Add a property `days: DayInfo[]` to store the 7 days of the week\n- Implement `ngOnInit()` lifecycle hook:\n  - Calculate the current week number using ISO 8601 week date standard\n  - Get the current date\n  - Find the Monday of the current week (start of week)\n  - Generate an array of 7 DayInfo objects (Monday through Sunday)\n  - For each day, calculate the date and format it appropriately\n- Add helper method `getWeekNumber(date: Date): number` to calculate ISO week number\n- Add helper method `getMonday(date: Date): Date` to get the Monday of a given date's week\n- Add helper method `formatDate(date: Date): string` to format dates as \"MMM DD\" (e.g., \"Jan 20\")\n\n### 5. Update App Component HTML\n- Update `app/client/src/app/app.component.html`\n- Remove all placeholder Angular content (the entire template from lines 1-336)\n- Create a new structure with:\n  - Header section displaying \"Week {{ weekNumber }}\" as the main title\n  - Main content section with a grid layout for the 7 days\n  - Use `@for` directive to loop through the days array: `@for (day of days; track day.dayName)`\n  - For each day, create a card/box containing:\n    - Day name header (e.g., \"Monday\")\n    - Date display (e.g., \"Jan 20\")\n    - Tasks container (empty placeholder with a message like \"No tasks yet\")\n- Add semantic HTML structure (header, main, section, article elements)\n\n### 6. Update App Component CSS\n- Update `app/client/src/app/app.component.css`\n- Remove all placeholder Angular styles (the entire :host style block from lines 11-177)\n- Create new styles for the weekly planner:\n  - Container styles with proper padding and max-width for readability\n  - Header styles for the week number title (centered, large font, proper spacing)\n  - Grid layout for the 7 days (use CSS Grid with 7 columns on desktop)\n  - Day card styles with borders, padding, shadows, and hover effects\n  - Day name header styles (bold, centered, background color)\n  - Date display styles (smaller font, gray color, centered)\n  - Task container placeholder styles (min-height, border, padding)\n  - Responsive styles using media queries:\n    - Tablet: 3-4 columns\n    - Mobile: 1-2 columns (stacked layout)\n  - Color scheme that is clean and professional (neutral colors with subtle accents)\n\n### 7. Run Validation Commands\n- Execute all validation commands listed below to ensure the chore is complete with zero regressions\n- Verify the application starts without errors\n- Check the browser at http://localhost:4200 to visually confirm the weekly view displays correctly\n- Verify server tests pass to ensure no backend regressions\n\n## Validation Commands\nExecute every command to validate the chore is complete with zero regressions.\n\n- `cd app/client && npm run build` - Build the Angular client to validate TypeScript compilation and catch any errors\n- `cd app/server && uv run pytest` - Run server tests to validate the chore is complete with zero regressions\n- `./scripts/start.sh` - Start both client and server to manually verify the weekly view displays correctly at http://localhost:4200\n\n## Notes\n- This chore focuses solely on the UI structure and week calculation logic. Task management functionality (add, edit, delete) will be implemented in future stories.\n- The week number calculation should use the ISO 8601 standard where weeks start on Monday and the first week of the year is the week containing the first Thursday.\n- The dates displayed should be dynamic based on the current date, showing the current week's Monday through Sunday.\n- The task containers are placeholders for now. They will be populated with actual tasks in future iterations when task loading and management features are implemented.\n- The Angular application uses standalone components (Angular 19+), so imports should be included directly in the component decorator.\n- The backend API already exists and supports task management, but this chore does not integrate with it yet. The task service is created as a foundation for future integration.\n- Consider accessibility: use semantic HTML, proper heading hierarchy, and ARIA labels where appropriate.\n- The styling should be responsive and work well on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.\n"
