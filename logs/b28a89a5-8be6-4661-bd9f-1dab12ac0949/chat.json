Creating TypeScript models for Task and DayInfo\n    2. Creating a task service for API communication\n    3. Updating app configuration for HttpClient\n    4. Implementing week/date calculation logic in the component\n    5. Building the weekly view HTML template\n    6. Styling the responsive weekly planner layout\n    7. Running validation commands\n  - Validation commands to ensure zero regressions (build, tests, manual verification)\n  - Implementation notes covering ISO 8601 week standards, responsive design, and accessibility considerations\n\nThe plan is ready for implementation and provides clear, unambiguous steps to accomplish the chore.\n\n**Plan file:** `/Users/muni/code/tac-week-planner/specs/chore-1-display-7-days-week.md`</command-args>"

Find the exact file path.\n- You can use these approaches to find it:\n  - Check git status for new untracked files\n  - Use `git diff --stat origin/main...HEAD specs/` to see new files in specs directory compared to origin/main\n  - Use `git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD specs/` to list only the file names\n  - Look for recently created .md files in the specs directory\n  - Parse the previous output which should mention where the plan was saved\n- Return ONLY the file path (e.g., \"specs/example-plan.md\") or \"0\" if not found.\n- Do not include any explanation, just the path or \"0\" if not found.\n\n## Previous Step Output\n\nPerfect!
