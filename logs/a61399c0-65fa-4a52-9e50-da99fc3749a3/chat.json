Find the exact file path.\n- You can use these approaches to find it:\n  - Check git status for new untracked files\n  - Use `git diff --stat origin/main...HEAD specs/` to see new files in specs directory compared to origin/main\n  - Use `git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD specs/` to list only the file names\n  - Look for recently created .md files in the specs directory\n  - Parse the previous output which should mention where the plan was saved\n- Return ONLY the file path (e.g., \"specs/example-plan.md\") or \"0\" if not found.\n- Do not include any explanation, just the path or \"0\" if not found.\n\n## Previous Step Output\n\nPerfect!
