/find_plan_file Perfect! I've created a comprehensive plan for the chore. Let me provide a summary of the work completed.

## Summary

I've successfully created a detailed plan for implementing the weekly planner display feature:

- **Researched the codebase** to understand the project structure:
  - Angular 19 client with standalone components
  - FastAPI backend with task management endpoints
  - Existing task model that supports day-of-week based tasks

- **Created comprehensive plan** at `specs/chore-1-display-7-days-week.md` that includes:
  - Clear chore description: Display 7 days of the week with dates and task containers
  - Week number (1-52) as the page title
  - Identified all relevant existing files (app component, config, styles)
  - Specified new files needed (task model, task service)
  - Detailed 7 step-by-step implementation tasks covering:
    1. Creating TypeScript models for Task and DayInfo
    2. Creating a task service for API communication
    3. Updating app configuration for HttpClient
    4. Implementing week/date calculation logic in the component
    5. Building the weekly view HTML template
    6. Styling the responsive weekly planner layout
    7. Running validation commands
  - Validation commands to ensure zero regressions (build, tests, manual verification)
  - Implementation notes covering ISO 8601 week standards, responsive design, and accessibility considerations

The plan is ready for implementation and provides clear, unambiguous steps to accomplish the chore.
