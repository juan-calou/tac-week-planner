## Summary

I've successfully created a detailed plan for implementing the weekly planner display feature:

- **Researched the codebase** to understand the project structure:
  - Angular 19 client with standalone components
  - FastAPI backend with task management endpoints
  - Existing task model that supports day-of-week based tasks

- **Created comprehensive plan** at `specs/chore-1-display-7-days-week.md` that includes:
  - Clear chore description: Display 7 days of the week with dates and task containers
  - Week number (1-52) as the page title
  - Identified all relevant existing files (app component, config, styles)
  - Specified new files needed (task model, task service)
  - Detailed 7 step-by-step implementation tasks covering:
    1. Creating TypeScript models for Task and DayInfo
    2. Creating a task service for API communication
    3. Updating app configuration for HttpClient
    4. Implementing week/date calculation logic in the component
    5. Building the weekly view HTML template
    6. Styling the responsive weekly planner layout
    7. Running validation commands
  - Validation commands to ensure zero regressions (build, tests, manual verification)
  - Implementation notes covering ISO 8601 week standards, responsive design, and accessibility considerations

The plan is ready for implementation and provides clear, unambiguous steps to accomplish the chore.

2026-01-21 10:40:39 - DEBUG - implement_response.output: ## Summary

I have successfully implemented the weekly planner feature according to the specification. Here's what was completed:

### Work Completed

1. **Created TypeScript Models** (app/client/src/app/models/task.model.ts)
   - Defined `Task` interface with all required properties matching the backend API
   - Defined `DayInfo` interface to represent each day in the week view

2. **Created Task Service** (app/client/src/app/services/task.service.ts)
   - Implemented Angular service with HttpClient for API communication
   - Added `getTasks()` method with error handling
   - Set up API base URL for backend communication

3. **Updated App Configuration** (app/client/src/app/app.config.ts)
   - Added `provideHttpClient()` to enable HTTP communication

4. **Updated App Component TypeScript** (app/client/src/app/app.component.ts)
   - Implemented `ngOnInit()` lifecycle hook to initialize the weekly view
   - Added `weekNumber` property to store the current ISO week number
   - Added `days` array to store 7 days of the week
   - Implemented helper methods:
     - `getWeekNumber()` - calculates ISO 8601 week number
     - `getMonday()` - gets Monday of the current week
     - `formatDate()` - formats dates as "MMM DD"

5. **Updated App Component HTML** (app/client/src/app/app.component.html)
   - Replaced placeholder content with weekly planner UI
   - Added header displaying "Week {{ weekNumber }}"
   - Created grid layout using `@for` directive to loop through 7 days
   - Each day card displays day name, date, and tasks container

6. **Updated App Component CSS** (app/client/src/app/app.component.css)
   - Implemented responsive grid layout (7 columns on desktop, 4 on tablet, 2 on mobile, 1 on small screens)
   - Styled day cards with hover effects
   - Added professional color scheme with blue header and clean borders
   - Implemented proper spacing and typography

### Validation Results

- **Client Build**: Successful compilation with no errors
- **Server Tests**: All 10 tests passed (10/10)
- **Manual Verification**: Both frontend (http://localhost:4200) and backend (http://localhost:5173) are running successfully

### Files and Lines Changed

**New Files:**
- app/client/src/app/models/task.model.ts (17 lines)
- app/client/src/app/services/task.service.ts (33 lines)

**Modified Files:**
- app/client/src/app/app.component.css (+140 lines)
- app/client/src/app/app.component.html (-331 lines net)
- app/client/src/app/app.component.ts (+43 lines)
- app/client/src/app/app.config.ts (+2 lines)

**Total Stats:**
- 6 files changed
- 263 insertions(+)
- 340 deletions(-)
- Net: -77 lines (replaced placeholder with actual implementation)

The weekly planner is now fully functional, displaying the current week number and all 7 days with their dates. The foundation is in place for future task management features.
