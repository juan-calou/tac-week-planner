/find_plan_file Perfect! I've successfully created the plan for this chore. Let me provide you with a summary of the work completed.

## Summary

I've created a comprehensive implementation plan for adding dates to the week title. Here's what was accomplished:

- **Created plan file**: `/Users/muni/code/tac-week-planner/specs/chore-3-add-dates-to-title.md`

- **Plan highlights**:
  - Updates the title from "Week ##" to "Week ## (MM/DD/YYYY to MM/DD/YYYY)" format
  - Modifies `app/client/src/app/app.component.ts` to add:
    - A new `weekTitle` property to store the complete title
    - A `formatDateMMDDYYYY()` helper method for proper date formatting with zero-padding
    - Logic in `ngOnInit()` to calculate Monday and Sunday dates and build the title string
  - Updates `app/client/src/app/app.component.html` to display the new `weekTitle` instead of just `weekNumber`
  - Includes validation commands to ensure zero regressions (build, tests, manual verification)

The plan is ready for implementation and follows the exact format requested, with detailed step-by-step tasks and proper validation steps.
