/find_plan_file Perfect! I've created a comprehensive feature plan for the "Add New Task" functionality. Let me provide a summary of the work completed.

## Summary

I've successfully created a detailed implementation plan for the "Add New Task" feature. Here's what was accomplished:

**Research Completed:**
- Analyzed the project structure (FastAPI backend with Angular frontend)
- Reviewed existing database schema and models (SQLite with tasks table)
- Examined current API endpoints (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE for tasks)
- Studied the frontend architecture (Angular standalone components, TaskService)
- Understood the existing data flow and patterns

**Feature Plan Created:**
- **Location:** `specs/feature-5-add-new-task.md`

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Extended the backend schema to add a `task_type` field (personal/work/other) to support task categorization as requested
- Leveraged existing API endpoints (POST /api/tasks for creation, GET /api/tasks for fetching)
- Designed a modal-based UI for task creation to maintain clean UX
- Mapped date input to existing `day_of_week` field in the backend
- Used a default `time_slot` value since the feature focuses on daily tasks rather than time-specific scheduling

**Plan Structure:**
- Complete feature description and user story
- Detailed relevant files list with explanations of what needs to change in each
- Three-phase implementation approach (Backend Foundation → UI Creation → Integration)
- 13 step-by-step tasks ordered logically from backend to frontend
- Comprehensive testing strategy including unit tests, integration tests, and edge cases
- Clear acceptance criteria and validation commands
- Helpful notes about schema migration and future enhancements

The plan follows the exact format specified and provides all the detail needed for successful implementation with zero ambiguity.
