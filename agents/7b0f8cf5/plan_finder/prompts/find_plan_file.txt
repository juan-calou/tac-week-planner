/find_plan_file Perfect! I've successfully created the bug plan. Let me provide a summary for the user.

## Report

I've analyzed the codebase and created a comprehensive bug plan for the two issues you reported:

**Bugs Identified:**

1. **Wrong Day Assignment**: Tasks appear in the previous day due to a timezone conversion issue in the `getDayOfWeekFromDate()` method. When the date input returns a string like "2026-01-22", converting it to a Date object treats it as UTC midnight, and calling `.getDay()` in a timezone behind UTC (e.g., PST) shifts the day backward by one.

2. **Missing Right Margin in Modal**: Form inputs in the modal use `width: 100%` without proper box-sizing, causing them to extend to the right edge without appropriate spacing.

**Plan Created:**
- Path: `specs/bug-7-fix-add-task-bugs.md`
- Includes detailed root cause analysis for both bugs
- Provides step-by-step tasks to fix the timezone issue and add proper spacing
- Contains validation commands and manual testing procedures
- Documents the technical details needed for a surgical fix

The plan is ready for implementation and follows the project's specification format.
