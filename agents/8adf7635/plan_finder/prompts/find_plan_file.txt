/find_plan_file Perfect! I've created a comprehensive plan for adding edit and delete functionality to tasks. Let me now provide a summary of the work completed.

## Summary

I've successfully created a comprehensive feature specification for adding edit and delete functionality to the task management system. Here's what was accomplished:

**Plan Created:**
- **File**: `/Users/muni/code/tac-week-planner/specs/feature-8-edit-delete-task.md`

**Key Highlights:**

- **Feature Scope**: Transform the weekly planner from a create-only system into a full CRUD application by adding:
  - Pencil icon on each task card to edit tasks (opens modal in edit mode)
  - Trash can icon on each task card to delete tasks (shows confirmation dialog)

- **Architecture Approach**:
  - Leverages existing backend endpoints (PATCH and DELETE already implemented)
  - Reuses the existing "Add New Task" modal for editing (with mode detection)
  - Adds confirmation dialog for deletion to prevent accidental removals
  - Only requires frontend changes (no backend modifications needed)

- **Implementation Plan**: Structured in 3 phases
  - Phase 1: Service layer updates (add updateTask/deleteTask methods)
  - Phase 2: Edit functionality (modal reuse, state management, form pre-population)
  - Phase 3: Delete functionality (confirmation dialog, action icons, styling)

- **Step-by-Step Tasks**: 20 detailed steps covering:
  - Service method additions
  - Component state management (edit mode, delete confirmation)
  - Template updates (action icons, modal title changes, confirmation dialog)
  - CSS styling (icons, hover effects, confirmation dialog, responsive design)
  - Comprehensive end-to-end testing

- **Files Involved**:
  - `app/client/src/app/services/task.service.ts` - Add update/delete service methods
  - `app/client/src/app/app.component.ts` - Edit/delete logic and state management
  - `app/client/src/app/app.component.html` - Action icons and confirmation dialog UI
  - `app/client/src/app/app.component.css` - Styling for icons and dialogs
  - Backend files require no changes (endpoints already exist)

- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive coverage including unit tests, integration tests, and edge cases like moving tasks between days, deleting the last task, and rapid clicking scenarios

The plan follows the exact format specified, includes all necessary implementation details, and provides clear validation commands to ensure zero regressions.
